            This is a horror movie about a door that is definitely not normal. At the start of the movie, we see a man walking down a path in a building. He is trying to enjoy some time out in nature, but gets a call from his wife. After hanging up, he walks a bit further and sees a door, standing alone along the pathway. Curious and confused, he approaches the door to take a look. He hears someone banging on the door, saying that they are trapped and begging him to close it. When he does this, a strange light appears and he is sucked into it. Soon after, he is thrown out onto the floor on the other side. Another man appears before him and asks him questions. The other man looks exactly like him and is wearing different clothes. When he asks who he is, the other man replies "Isn't it obvious". It is clear that he has met a future version of himself. He tells his older self that he wants to leave this place, but the older self, who has become aggressive after a long time in this environment, tells him that only one person can leave. They have a brief struggle, which soon ends with a monster (which looks like a bear) terrorizing the younger man. The older man uses his opportunity to escape. When he gets out, he sees his younger self approaching the door while having the phone conversation from the start of the movie. The movie ends with the younger man trapped, screaming for help and trying to get out.
