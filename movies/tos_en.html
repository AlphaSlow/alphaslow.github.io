            This is a story of humans trying to prevent destruction by robots. It starts with a scene of two young adults, Thom and Celia, standing outside at the beach. It's clear that they are a couple that is breaking up because they have different interests - space travel and robotics - and also because Thom has trouble accepting Celia's robot arm. The movie then cuts to an futuristic scene of some scientists doing something with a brain. Outside, we see an armed guard (Barley) monitoring for danger. Next to him, an old man wakes up and goes down some stairs into a building. There, we see a giant robot. The scientists start a machine and a hologram appears, creating the scene of the breakup that we saw at the beginning of the movie. The old man enters the hologram, and his appearance changes into that of Thom, his younger self. We see him reenact the breakup scene with the giant robot, but he is unable to do it convincingly. While this is happening, the scientists try to overwrite the memories in the brain that they had been working with. But things start going wrong. Barley warns that there is danger coming in 2 days. There is some kind of technology failure. And the robot, which now looks like Celia, is furious with Thom and threatening violence. Just then, Thom starts to change the script and explain his real feelings. Just then, robots arrive and start attacking, while several of the people try frantically to fight them off. In the hologram, we see Celia start to be convinced by Thom's performance and the memory overwrite of the brain is completed. As a robot damages the machinery, the hologram breaks and we see Thom and Celia in their current forms: an old man and a giant bird. We learn that the brain was actually Celia's and it becomes clear that she was controlling the robot army. By overwriting her memories, the humans have been able to change her attitude. At the end of the movie, we see Thom and Celia fighting while robots move around the facility. The robots do not seem to be attacking humans, suggesting that the mission to stop them has been a success.
