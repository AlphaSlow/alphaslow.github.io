            This is a story of personal connections. At the start of the movie, we see a singer having a bad day. At an audition, she fails without getting any real attention. Then her boyfriend leaves her a message saying that he has found someone else. She misses her train and has to wait at the train station. There, she meets a young girl and her grandmother, who invite her back to a restaurant for lunch. There, she relaxes and starts to become friendly with the girl. Her grandmother, who is happy to see this, invites her to stay longer. We see Robin doing several activities with the family. The first is a game in which they have to hit a cake while wearing a blindfold. While playing this game, the grandmother and granddaughter can see that Robin has a lot of anger inside her. Later, Robin spends time with each of them individually. While they are playing tennis, the grandmother thanks Robin for being a friend to her lonely granddaughter. Robin admits to the grandmother that she has lied to herself by not admitting that she was not ok. When it is time to leave, the girl has a hard time saying goodbye and it is clear that Robin has had a big impact on her. At the end of the film, we see Robin howling at the moon and running into the jungle with her clothes on. It is clear that her new friendships have helped her a lot.
