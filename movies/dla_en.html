            The movie opens with a scene of a girl, Savannah, washing her hair. Her brother shouts at her from outside and they argue about who should do the chores. He opens her bedroom door and jokingly insults her. She responds by slamming the door and telling him to go away. She walks over to the window and looks out into the garden. There, she sees a creepy looking man standing behind a tree. The man's face is covered by a mask and he is wearing a black and white suit with a torn jacket. Right after seeing him, her phone rings and she answers it. It's her father calling. She tells him about the weird looking man. The father tells her not to look away from the man and that he will be home soon. Her brother knocks on the door and opens it. She tells him to lock all the doors in the house, but before doing that, he looks outside and sees the man in the suit. She explains to Jim that he must keep looking at the man, and says that she is going to lock the doors. She thinks that if one person looks at it, it will be good enough. But after locking the doors, she can't see the man anymore, even though Jim can. Suddenly she sees the creepy man sitting in her room. Savannah covers the man's nose with tape, thinking that that would protect her, but when she looks away, it attacks her. Jim jumps in to defend her. After a short fight, they can both see the man in the room, so he stops moving. The children's father runs into the room. He picks up a mirror and holds it in front of the man's face. When the man looks into the mirror, he is sucked into it. The father then smashes the mirror. Savannah demands an explanation for what has happened. Her father explains that the man has been following him and his wife for a long time. Suddenly, Jim realizes that he can't see the man that he was looking at outside. The father tells them that the creepy man had been able to make a copy of himself. When the doorbell rings, they realize that the danger is not over. The movie ends with the creepy looking man standing in the house. </p>
