            In this story, Crow is given an important mission. The film starts with a happy scene of animals in the forest. We see Crow practicing singing his signature tune "When You Can Fly" and learn that he is famous in the forest. But then one day, spring comes to the forest for the first time and the animals don't know how to handle it. Owl comes up with a plan to save the forest. They need someone to fly through space and find The One Who Creates Everything By Thinking and convince her to "unthink" the cold. But Turtle and Skunk can't fly, Owl has difficulty flying and Moth would be in danger of flying into the moon. At first, Crow is unwilling, but eventually the other animals convince him. So Crow flies past the moon and sun in a long journey through space. Back in the forest, the animals start to worry about Crow. Moth flies off to search for him, despite protests from the other animals. In the meantime, Crow finds a majestic glowing palace. In the middle of it, in a small container, he sees a small purple cat - The One Who Creates Everything By Thinking. He finds it difficult to wake her up, so he sings his signature tune again. This gets her attention. We see her create things just by thinking about it, such as a treadmill. Crow asks her for help and she eventually gives him a paper and sets it on fire, telling him not to let it burn out. On the way back, Crow finds Moth flying into the sun, but grabs him just in time and drags him to a nearby asteroid. On the asteroid, Crow accidentally knocks over the branch and it goes out. Crow comes up with a dangerous plan to light the branch in the sun. Moth and the sun warn him not to do it but he is too determined. Back in the forest, we see fire falling from the sky and lighting up a branch. The animals are excited by the warmth, but soon become worried because they can't see Turtle. Crow appears and looks sad. His voice and feathers have changed after being burned by the sun. Skunk tries to cheer him up, but it doesn't seem to work. But just then, everything changes. The One Who Creates Everything By Thinking, impressed by Crow's sacrifice, transforms the whole forest, bringing back the good weather. Crow is thrilled. The movie ends with Crow singing in his new voice, while the other animals dance around happily.
