              This is the story of a young shepherd and her dog performing a seasonal ritual. They start in a beautiful place on top of a mountain, but soon journey down into a dark and icy beach. The dog leads the girl to a rock, which she hits hard with her staff. This awakens a mysterious creature with long, tree-like legs. The creature taps her staff with parts of its antennae to create a short tune. The girl taps different parts of the antennae to finish the tune. Each part plays a different musical note. The creature gives one of the parts (notes) to her. She puts it in her staff and it lights up and starts glowing orange. She hits the ground with her staff and then creatures all around the forest start to fall down. A falling tree branch knocks the note out of the staff, which makes the forest creatures restless and scares the girl. They all start to frantically chase the note as it bounces down a path. This creates a dangerous situation, as the girl and dog are in danger of being trampled by the creatures' giant wings. The dog barely manages to prevent the note from falling off a cliff. Moments away from being crushed, the girl grabs the note and puts it back into the staff. This upsets the creatures. Using the staff, she manages to lead the creatures out of the forest. This brings spring to the forest. In a sad ending, the girl hangs the note on a chain of other notes. The camera pans to show a huge cliff full of notes, showing that this has all happened many times before.
