            <p id="mistakes-text-content">
            At the start of the movie, we see a girl sleeping in her bed. When she wakes up, she realizes the time and suddenly jumps into action. She gets ready for school as fast as she can, then takes a taxi and rushes to the bus stop. On reaching the bus stop, she sees her bus leaving and realizes that she is late. Disappointed, she sits down on a bench to wait for her bus. Suddenly, she hears an old man ask her a question. She explains her situation to him. The man then asks about her watch and we learn that it was given to her by her sister. The girl then asks about the old man, who tells her that he is going to see someone he hasn't seen in a long time. Soon after this, the girl's bus arrives and she moves to it. She turns around to say goodbye, but he is gone and all she can see is a book. On the bus, she reads it and it says "Check your watch". She does this and the watch seems to be working again, showing a time of 8:30. She asks someone the time, and the lady confirms that it is 8:30. It seems impossible because at the start of the movie it was 8:54. We see her think about this and start to sing. It has become clear to her that the person she met at the bus stop was her grandfather. </p>
