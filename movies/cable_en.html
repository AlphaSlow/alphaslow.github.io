              This is a story about the difficulties of working for the wrong company. The main character, who is called Anthony, works at an internet service provider. He does call center work, dealing with customer complaints. On top of this, he has to ensure that customers are receiving the fastest internet possible. He provides their internet by running up a mountain, and the faster he runs, the faster their internet is. He must keep increasing his speed so that his company can keep up with its competitors. We see him doing all kinds of training, including jogging, weight training and swimming. He trains and runs harder and harder, while not sleeping enough. During this time, he also has other problems, like bad food and lack of contact with his family. When he does finally talk to his father, we learn that he is sick and needs treatment. Gary continues the training, but eventually his body reaches its limit and he collapses while running. His uncle tells him that other companies have developed a faster technology ("relay technology") and that he is being replaced. We see him being forced to leave the office as a cycling team moves in to replace him. At the end of the movie, he finally manages to see his father and they finally make a real human connection. The story illustrates how some companies force people to work too hard, give them difficult conditions (bad food) and prevent them from doing the important things in life, such as seeing their loved ones.
