                            <li>Meet for a short level test and discussion. If possible, we will try to put you in a class with people that are a similar level/age.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you have all the requirements, such as Zoom and a place to speak.</li>
                            <li>Pay for the lessons.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>A quiet place to talk. In 1 to 1 lessons, this can be less important. But in group lessons, noise from one person affects everyone, so a cafe or noisy office is not a good place to do this.</li>
                            <li>Zoom. Although Zoom is not the only way to arrange online meetings, it has some good functions that make it easy to give feedback, make groups, etc.</li>
                            <li>A camera. We use cameras in our lessons. We know that some people have security concerns about illegal recording and deepfakes. But, from experience, much more fun to participate in a class of people that you can see. Consider sunglasses or a hat if you are concerned about safety.</li>
                            <li>Free time. Most of the lessons won't take up so much time. In general, you can expect to do less than two hours a week (class time + preparation). For most people, this can work, but if you don't have two hours a week to spare, it's probably better to practice on your own.</li>

                        <p>For most classes, we will try to do one session per week. For adults, this will usually be done at night to accommodate people with jobs. It is often possible to adjust the schedule according to the needs of the student, so contact us if you want to find out more about times.</p>

                        <p>There are many different ways to study on your own. But remember, learning a language takes a lot of time, so you don't want to spend it doing something boring. We recommend finding something you love to do and do it in your target language. Books and TV shows are great examples of things that will help you learn.</p>

                        <p>We will only offer refunds in special cases, such as medical issues. We try to find groups of the right size and composition. If someone drops out, there is a negative impact on the group, like the possibility that someone loses their partner. But don't worry. You probably won't want to quit!</p>
